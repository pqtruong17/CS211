    <span class="section">Rules:</span>
    </p><ol>
        <li>This exercise may be completed in groups.</li>
      <li>You may not import any extra functionality besides the default.  For example, <code>System</code> and <code>Math</code> are imported by default and thus may be used, whereas something like <code>ArrayList</code> must be explicitly imported so it is disallowed.</li>
      <li>The <code>main</code> method in any class will not be tested; you may use it any way you want.</li>
      <li>Comment your code using the Javadoc style. Since most methods are fairly short, focus on documenting the classes and their relationships.</li>
      <li>You may add additional fields (but not methods) as long as they are <code>private</code> (<b><i>not</i></b> <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code> or default).</li>
      <li>Use proper encapsulation.</li>
      </ol>

	  <span class="section">Robot Class</span> 
    </p><p>
      The term "robot" (at least in popular usage) can refer to a very broad category of things, and yet there is a common image that we often have in mind when discussing robots in general: machines that interact with the world. Usually, we categorize different types of robots based on their capabilities. Let's create a general class that identifies some common capabilities that different robots might have, with the possibility that new capabilities might be added in the future. The <code>Robot</code> class we are about to write will be a general class which we can use to describe any type of robot - we won't worry about the specifics yet, and instead we'll use subclasses to describe those.
    </p><p>
      Our <code>Robot</code> class will include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A public constructor, with the parameters <code>int serialNumber, boolean flies, boolean autonomous, boolean teleoperated</code>. The <code>serialNumber</code> is a number which uniquely identifies the robot, while the remaining parameters all represent different capabilities a robot can have: if <code>flies</code> is true, the robot can move through the air, <code>autonomous</code> is true when the robot can act on its own without a human operator, and <code>teleoperated</code> indicates whether a human can operate the robot manually.</li>
      <li>A void method with public access called <code>setCapabilities</code> for setting the capabilities after object creation with the parameter list <code>boolean flies, boolean autonomous, boolean teleoperated</code>.</li>
	  <li>A public getter called <code>getSerialNumber</code> for the serialNumber.  We do not need a setter because we do not expect to change the serial number after it is set (it may even make sense to declare the method and the corresponding field <code>final</code>).</li>
	  <li>Public methods <code>canFly</code>, <code>isAutonomous</code>, and <code>isTeleoperated</code>, each of which take no parameters and return <code>boolean</code>.  These method indicate which capabilities the robot supports.  They may be redefined in subclasses, but for now, each of these methods should return whatever the capabilities were set to.</li>
	  <li> A public <code>getCapabilities</code> method that takes no parameters and which returns a String containing each of the capabilities of the robot separated by spaces. For example, if <code>canFly</code> returns <code>true</code>, <code>isAutonomous</code> returns <code>false</code>, and <code>isTeleoperated</code> returns <code>true</code>, then <code>getCapabilities</code> should return the string "canFly isTeleoperated" (order and case are important). If all three returned <code>true</code> the string should be "canFly isAutonomous isTeleoperated". If none of them return <code>true</code>, the empty string should be returned (""). NOTE: in order for this method to work correctly for subclasses, you should use the previously defined <code>canFly, isAutonomous,</code> and <code>isTeleoperated</code> methods rather than access any data members directly.</li>
 	  <li>An overridden <code>toString</code> method which returns a String in the format <code>"ID: <i>&lt;serialNumber&gt;</i>, Capabilities: <i>&lt;list of capabilities&gt;</i>"</code> (replacing with actual serial number and list of capabilities).</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
  	<span class="section">Drone Class</span>
  </p>
  <p>
  	Our simplest type of robot will represent a drone. Even though many different types of drones exist, they all have the same basic functionality, at least for the purposes of this project. All drones can fly, are teleoperated and not autonomous. To implement this subclass, we need to define the following:
  </p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>Extend the <code>Robot</code> class.</li>
  		<li>A public constructor with just a single parameter: <code>int serialNumber</code>. Hint: you will need to explicitly invoke the superclass constructor with the correct arguments.</li>
  		<li>An overridden <code>canFly</code> method which always returns <code>true</code>.</li>
  		<li>An overridden <code>isAutonomous</code> method which always returns <code>false</code>.</li>
  		<li>An overridden <code>isTeleoperated</code> method which always returns <code>true</code>.</li>
  	</ul>
  </li>
  	NOTE: this class <b>does not</b> define or override the <code>getCapabilities</code> method, but it is still inherited by this subclass, and it should still give the correct output when on instances of this subclass. If you've followed the note above, this will be the case.
  <p>
  <span class="section">Vacuum Class</span> 
  </p>
  <p>
  	Our next type of robot is the humble vacuum, a consumer product which autonomously vacuums your house.  All vacuums have the same basic capabilities: they can't fly or be teleoperated, but they are autonomous, and they also have the ability to clean.  To implement this subclass, we need to define the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Extend the <code>Robot</code> class.</li>
  	<li>A public constructor with just a single parameter: <code>int serialNumber</code>. See hint from previous class</li>
  	<li>A new public method, <code>canClean</code> which takes no arguments and returns true.</li>
  	<li>An overridden <code>getCapabilities</code> method which returns a string in the same format as the parent class <code>Robot</code>, but with the additional <code>canClean</code> capability at the end.</li>
  	<li>Overridden versions of each of three boolean methods from the parent class, as was done for the <code>Drone</code> class.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  	<span class="section">MovieRobot Class</span>
  </p>
  <p>
  	In addition to robots that exist in the real world, there is a rich (if not technically accurate) history of robots in film. The capabilities of these robots vary widely from film to film, so unlike the previous two subclasses we won't "hard code" the capabilities, but we will introduce a new capability that most movie robots have: speech. Invariably, whenever a MovieRobot is capable of speech it will have a catchphrase, so we'll store that in our class as well. Lastly, since there are no examples of generic MovieRobots - only robots from specific movies - we'll make MovieRobot an <code>abstract</code> class.
  </p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Extend the <code>Robot</code> class.</li>
  	<li>A public constructor with the parameters <code>int serialNumber, boolean flies, boolean autonomous, boolean teleoperated, String catchphrase</code>. Hint: you can use the parent class' constructor to set the other capabilities first, and then set the robots catchphrase.</li>
  	<li>An overloaded four argument constructor which by default sets the catchphrase to <code>null</code>. Hint: if you followed the previous note, you can chain constructors to accomplish this in one line.</li>
  	<li>Add a new public <b>abstract</b> method, <code>canSpeak</code> which takes no arguments and returns a boolean. The subclasses of MovieRobot will need to make sure this method returns <code>true</code> when they have a non-null catchphrase.</li>
  	<li>An overridden <code>getCapabilities</code> method which returns a string in the same format as the parent class <code>Robot</code>, but with the additional <code>canSpeak</code> capability at the end (if true).</li>
  	<li>An overridden <code>toString</code> method which returns a string in the same format as the parent class <code>Robot</code>, and if the robot can speak appends a space followed by the catchphrase surrounded by quotation marks. (If the robot cannot speak, nothing should be appended)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  	<span class="section">MovieRobot Subclasses</span>
  </p>
  <p>
  	Once we've made a subclass, we can keep building off of it by making new classes which derive from the subclass. We'll create three subclasses of MovieRobots from iconic films (all three of these classes should be concrete):
  	<ul>
  		<li>A <code>HAL9000</code> subclass which extends <code>MovieRobot</code>, which flies and has the catchphrase "I can't let you do that Dave."</li>
  		<li>A <code>Replicant</code> subclass which extends <code>MovieRobot</code>, which has the catchphrase "like tears in rain..." and the additional capability <code>fight</code>.</li>
  		<li>A <code>TeeOneThousand</code> subclass which extends <code>MovieRobot</code>, which cannot speak, but can also clean (oddly enough).</li>
  	</ul>
  	For each of these subclasses, make sure you override and add methods where appropriate, as you did in the previous subclasses. The easiest way to make sure the catchphrase for each subclass is correct is by calling the constructor from the parent class in each subclass constructor. Note: you will need to figure out what <i>additional</i> parameters each subclass constructor should take from the description above and the parameters required by the superclass.

  <span class="section">Testing:</span>
  <p>
    You are responsible for ensuring your code functions correctly according to the description provided above. A <b><i>validation checker</i></b> will be made available on gradescope which will try to catch errors that would prevent the autograder from running. Passing this validation check does not guarantee that all of the required logic has been implemented correctly. You should write your own tests which exercise all of the required functionality in a variety of different situations in order to verify that your code operates as you expect it to. <b>Code which does not compile or fails any of the validation checks may receive zero credit.</b>
